🚀 Packet Tracer - Use Telnet and SSH 🖥️🔑
👨‍💻 Project Overview
Welcome to the Telnet and SSH Remote Access Party! 🎉 In this exciting activity, you'll get the chance to establish a remote session to a router using Telnet and SSH. Get ready to feel like a network magician as you gain access to devices from anywhere in your network!

📚 What is Telnet and SSH?
Telnet: It's like sending a secret letter to a router. You can connect to it and issue commands as if you’re sitting right in front of it (but much cooler).

SSH (Secure Shell): Think of SSH as the "cooler, safer, and more encrypted" version of Telnet. It ensures that no one can snoop on your connections. 😎

🛠️ Objectives
Telnet: Establish a remote session using Telnet (because who wants to be stuck physically connected to a router?).

SSH: Connect using SSH (it’s like Telnet, but better and safer).

Remote Access Magic: You'll be performing remote access like a network wizard, casting commands from afar.

🖼️ How to Setup the Remote Session
Step 1: 🧑‍💻 Configure the Router

Go to your router, get the magic password set up, and prepare it for remote visitors (you)!

Step 2: 🕹️ Start Telnet!

Use your Telnet connection to make a remote visit and issue commands. It’s like calling a friend and telling them to open the fridge remotely (without actually going there).

Step 3: 🔐 SSH!

Once you're feeling confident, move on to SSH, and enjoy the secure, encrypted remote access.

Step 4: 🎮 Test Your Connections!

Test both Telnet and SSH to make sure everything is working perfectly and that you can access your router like a pro.

📊 Network Diagram
Check out this super cool network diagram I made that illustrates the entire process! You'll see how Telnet and SSH fit into the picture perfectly. Trust me, it’s as easy as pie (and a whole lot more fun)!
