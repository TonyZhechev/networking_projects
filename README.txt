 Wireless Router and Client Lab

## Project Overview
This lab demonstrates the configuration of a wireless router and a wireless client in Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes:
- Wireless router setup with WPA2-PSK security.
- DHCP configuration for automatic IP assignment.
- Wireless client connection and connectivity testing.

## Devices Used
- Linksys WRT300N Wireless Router
- 1 Wired PC
- 1 Wireless Laptop
- 1 Server (optional for internet simulation)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Verify the router's settings in the **GUI** tab.
3. Test connectivity:
   - `ping` the router from the wired PC and wireless laptop.
   - If configured, test internet access using the server.

## Files
- `wireless-router-client.pkt`: The Packet Tracer project file for this lab.

## Next Steps
- Add advanced features like QoS or VLAN configurations.
- Experiment with different security modes.
