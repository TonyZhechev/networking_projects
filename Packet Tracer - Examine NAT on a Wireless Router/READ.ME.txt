# **Packet Tracer - Examine NAT on a Wireless Router**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to configure and examine **Network Address Translation (NAT)** on a **wireless router** using Cisco Packet Tracer. Additionally, we will configure four PCs to connect to the router via **DHCP** and analyze the NAT process using Packet Tracer’s **simulation mode**.

## **Objectives**
1. Examine NAT configuration on a wireless router.
2. Set up four PCs to connect to a wireless router using DHCP.
3. Monitor and analyze network traffic using NAT.

## **Network Topology**

### **Devices Required**
- **Wireless Router** (e.g., Linksys WRT300N)
- **4 PCs** (connected wirelessly via DHCP)
- **ISP Router/Cloud** (simulating Internet connection)
- **External Web Server** (to test NAT connectivity)

## **Step-by-Step Configuration**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Wireless Router**
1. Open Packet Tracer and place a **Wireless Router**.
2. Connect the router’s **Internet Port** to an **ISP Router/Cloud** (using an Ethernet cable).
3. Configure the **Wireless Router**:
   - **Go to GUI mode** → **Setup Tab** → **Basic Setup**.
   - **Set Internet Connection Type:** DHCP (to receive an IP from ISP).
   - **Local Network Configuration:**
     - **Router IP:** `192.168.1.1`
     - **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
     - **DHCP Server:** Enabled
     - **DHCP IP Range:** `192.168.1.100 - 192.168.1.149`

### **Step 2: Configure Wireless Settings**
1. **Go to Wireless Tab** → **Basic Wireless Settings**.
2. Set:
   - **SSID:** `MyWiFi`
   - **Security Mode:** WPA2-Personal
   - **Password:** `cisco123`

### **Step 3: Connect PCs to Wi-Fi**
1. Click on each **PC** → Go to **Desktop > PC Wireless**.
2. Select **MyWiFi**, enter the password (`cisco123`), and click **Connect**.
3. Verify the **PC receives an IP** from the router (`192.168.1.100-149`).

### **Step 4: Verify NAT Configuration**
1. Open the **Wireless Router CLI**.
2. Enter the following command:
   ```bash
   show ip nat translations
   ```
3. This displays the mapping of private IPs (`192.168.1.x`) to the router’s **public WAN IP**.

### **Step 5: Test Connectivity & Analyze NAT Traffic**
#### **1. Test Internet Connectivity**
- Open **Command Prompt** on a PC and run:
  ```bash
  ping 8.8.8.8
  ```
- If the ping is successful, NAT is working correctly.

#### **2. Capture NAT Traffic (Simulation Mode)**
1. Click on **Simulation Mode** (bottom-right in Packet Tracer).
2. **Filter packets** to show only **ICMP or HTTP**.
3. Observe how private IPs (`192.168.1.x`) are translated to the public IP when reaching the external server.

## **Expected Results**
- **All four PCs should receive IP addresses** from the DHCP server on the router.
- **NAT should translate private IPs** to the router’s **public WAN IP**.
- **Internet connectivity should be successful** when pinging external servers.
- **Traffic analysis in simulation mode** should show private-to-public IP translation.

## **Troubleshooting Guide**
### **1. PCs Not Getting IP Addresses?**
✅ Check if **DHCP is enabled** on the wireless router.
✅ Verify that PCs are connected to the correct **Wi-Fi network (MyWiFi)**.

### **2. No Internet Connectivity?**
✅ Ensure the **ISP Router/Cloud is connected** to the wireless router’s **Internet Port**.
✅ Verify the **router received a public IP** from the ISP (GUI → Status → WAN IP).

### **3. NAT Not Translating?**
✅ Run `show ip nat translations` on the router CLI.
✅ Ensure PCs are sending traffic to external networks.
✅ Restart the router and try again.

## **Conclusion**
- This project successfully demonstrates **NAT operation on a wireless router**.
- **DHCP and NAT** ensure smooth connectivity for internal devices.
- Using **Packet Tracer’s Simulation Mode**, we can observe **NAT translations in real time**.
