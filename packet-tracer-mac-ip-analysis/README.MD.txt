Packet Tracer - Identify MAC and IP Addresses
 Overview
This project involves analyzing MAC and IP addresses in both local and remote network communications using Cisco Packet Tracer. The activity focuses on gathering PDU information to understand how data packets travel across networks.

 Objectives
1. Gather PDU Information for Local Network Communication.
2. Gather PDU Information for Remote Network Communication.

 Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

Steps
1. **Local Network Communication**:
   - Sent a PDU between two devices on the same network.
   - Captured and analyzed the MAC and IP addresses.
2. **Remote Network Communication**:
   - Sent a PDU between devices on different networks.
   - Observed how MAC addresses change while IP addresses remain consistent.



 Key Learnings
- Understanding of ARP and how MAC addresses are resolved.
- Insight into how routers facilitate communication between different networks.

 How to Run
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Switch to Simulation Mode.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the README to replicate the analysis.
