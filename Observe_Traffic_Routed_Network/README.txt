Packet Tracer - Observe Traffic Flow in a Routed Network

## üìù Overview
This project demonstrates how network traffic moves between LANs when routing is enabled. Using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, we analyze packet movement and simulate traffic flow.



## üõ† Steps Performed
1. **Setup Devices**: Added PCs, switches, and a router.
2. **Configured Static IPs**: Each LAN received its subnet.
3. **Tested Without Routing**: Pings between LANs failed.
4. **Configured Router for Routing**: Used multiple interfaces.
5. **Retested Connectivity**: Successful cross-subnet communication.
6. **Used Simulation Mode**: Observed traffic flow in Packet Tracer.

## üìÇ Files Included
- `traffic-flow.pkt` - Packet Tracer project file.
- `network-diagram.png` - Visual representation of the network.
- `README.md` - Detailed documentation.

## ‚úÖ Expected Results
- PCs in the same LAN can always communicate.
- PCs in **different LANs** will only communicate **after routing is configured**.
- Simulation Mode shows how packets travel through **switches and routers**.
